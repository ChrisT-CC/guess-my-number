# Guess my number

**Guess my number** is a simple casual game. Almost anyone with access to a device will be able to play it. The player has 10 tries to guess a randomly generated number form 1 to 100. After the initial guess, the player will get a feedback to find the number "you guess is lower/higher then my number". 

Have fun!!

A live version of the game will be here:
